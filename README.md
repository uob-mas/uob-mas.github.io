# Welcome to Social AI and Multi-Agent Systems Research at Bristol!

We are a team of researchers advancing foundational AI for the societal good, focusing on enabling ethical sociotechnical systems. 
Our work encompasses intelligent agents and normative multi-agent systems, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and graph-based approaches, all while integrating normative principles to ensure that AI systems align with societal norms and values.

Our research seeks to facilitate interactions between computational agents and social entities, such as humans and organizations, with a strong emphasis on promoting prosocial behaviour and ensuring equitable outcomes.

We are based in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/science-engineering/schools/computer-science/) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk). 
Our team is part of the federated [Intelligent Systems Labs](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/groups/intelligent-systems/), which comprises several units focussing on AI, machine learning, and data science research. We are affiliated with the [Collective Dynamics lab](https://uob-colldyn.github.io/) and the [AI lab](https://uob-ai-lab.github.io/) units.
