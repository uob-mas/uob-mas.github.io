## Welcome to Social AI and Multi-Agent Systems Research at Bristol!

We are a team of researchers advancing foundational AI for the societal good, focusing on the development of ethical multi-agent systems. 

Our work encompasses intelligent agents and multi-agent systems, social AI, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and graph-based approaches, all while integrating normative principles to ensure that AI systems align with societal norms and values.

We are based in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/science-engineering/schools/computer-science/) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk). 
Our team is a part of the federated [Intelligent Systems Labs](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/groups/intelligent-systems/), affiliated with the [Collective Dynamics lab](https://uob-colldyn.github.io/) and the AI lab.
