# Welcome to Social AI and Multi-Agent Systems Research at Bristol!

We are a team of researchers advancing foundational AI for the societal good, focusing on the development of ethical sociotechnical systems. Our work encompasses intelligent agents and multi-agent systems, social AI, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and graph-based approaches, all while integrating normative principles to ensure that AI systems align with societal norms and values.

We are part of the federated [Intelligent Systems Labs](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/groups/intelligent-systems/) at Bristol, affiliated with the [Collective Dynamics lab](https://uob-colldyn.github.io/) and the AI lab.
